In an era of smart cities and digital solutions, efficient vehicle parking management is a growing necessity. The QR Code and AI-based Smart Vehicle Parking Management System is designed to streamline parking operations by combining the power of QR code technology and AI-driven intelligence.

When a user books a parking slot, a unique QR code is generated, which is then verified at the parking entrance through License Plate Recognition (LPR) and AI for enhanced security and accuracy. This seamless process allows for easy entry without the need for manual checks, as the system automatically cross-references the license plate and QR code.

Additionally, Occupancy Detection & Prediction enables real-time monitoring and forecasting of parking space availability, ensuring optimal usage of the parking area.

The system incorporates Dynamic Pricing Optimization, adjusting fees based on demand to enhance operational efficiency and maximize revenue.

To further improve user experience, AI-Powered Customer Support through chatbots and virtual assistants is available for booking, payment, and inquiries.

Lastly, Smart Lighting for Energy Efficiency Optimization adjusts lighting based on real-time occupancy, contributing to sustainability. This comprehensive solution not only simplifies parking management but also elevates user convenience through advanced technology.
